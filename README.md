# Prework Study guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is a short guide intended for use by anyone studying the front end web development bootcamp course

I created this project to give me experience with GitHub and provide notes on important concepts I had learned throughout the course

As I go along the course, I hope to build this repository full of useful information which I can reguarly look back on to revise key concepts and in particular further develop my Git skills.

So far I have learnt Git to a basic level. I'm comfortable with the overall workflow, I just need to remember a lot of the commands!

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
